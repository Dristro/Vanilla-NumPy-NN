Implementation of a feed-forward netural net.

Most of the "structure" is inspired mostly by PyTorch (partially TensorFlow).
The code is almost done, there are some bugs that are to be fixed.

Will convert the notebook content into python scripts such that the repo can be used to import and use locally as a Python library.

<u>Libraries</u>:
- **NumPy** (using 1.26.4, but any latest version from Python=3.8> should work)
- **Matplotlib** (using 3.9.2, didnt test with other versions)
- **Jupyter notebook** >=7.2.0 (for the notebook code, will be depricated once the code is converted in scripts)
- **Pandas** (2.2.0>)
